					About me
				</div>
I am a web developer based in Madrid who enjoys learning and sharpening his skills, but has a very bad memory and needs a place to gather his findings.
<p/><p/>
My daily tools of the trade are Python, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Git, TurboGears 2, MongoDB, Nginx... So you can expect posts regarding any and all of these technologies.
<p/>
This blog will help me keep track of software projects I’m working on and things I’ve learned. It is not intended to show off any spectacular knowledge. It is just a place for me to keep small snippets of code which I use recurringly but never manage to remember.
<p/>
Feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/richas">Twitter</a>.
